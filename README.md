# Bowling Kata

In an attempt to get familiar with Scala I wanted to try reimplementing the Bowling Kata.

The description I've seen of the problem is [here.](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/acsbowling/)

Paraphrasing:

> We are going to create an object, BowlingGame, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game.

> Here are some things that the program will not do:
> *  We will not check for valid rolls.
> *  We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
> * We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.

The solution here uses SBT and ScalaTest.

## Thoughts

This solution is very Java-y and imperative. I will hopefully revisit this once I'm a bit more familiar with Scala constructs.
